# Plotting results of Local Moran's I statistic generated by localmoran{spdep}

Two functions are contained in the source plotlocalmoran.R

plot.local.moran, produces a cluster plot of Local Moran's I statistic generated by [localmoran{spdep}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spdep/spdep.pdf).  

Argument | Description
--- | ---
x | spatialpolygonsdataframe
variable.name | double quote variable name, e.g. "houseValue"
local.moran | localmoran object from spdep
weights | spatial weights object from spdep
sig | p value, default is sig = 0.05
plot.only.significant | Plot only the statistically significant clusters, default is TRUE
legend.location | A single keyword "bottomright", "bottom", "bottomleft", "left", "topleft", "top", "topright", "right" and "center".

You can try out the tool with the following code:

## sp.remove.na.rows()

The second is a helper function for removing rows in a spatailpolygonsdataframe or spatialpointsdataframe where NAs occur. You specify the column name to check for NAs.
